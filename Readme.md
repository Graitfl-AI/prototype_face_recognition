# Title: Eye-Contact Improvement in Videoconferencing
## Overview:
Video conferencing applications have gained widespread adoption, facilitating remote work and virtual learning. Despite their convenience, maintaining eye contact in video calls poses a challenge, as users tend to look at the displayed participant rather than into the camera, which is typically located at the top of the screen. This deviation from direct camera contact can create the perception that the user is not fully engaged with the other participant. 
In this project, we implement a face detection Picture in Picture system to improve eye-contact in videoconferencing, it utilizes OpenCV for face detection and PyAutoGUI for mouse pointer screenshots.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: pip install opencv-python pyautogui numpy

Usage:
- Run the program: python file_name.py
- Press ‘x’ to zoom in and ‘y’ to zoom out.
- Press ‘q’ to quit the program.

Features:
1. Real-time face detection using Opencv
2. Smooth mouse movement for Picture in picture support
3. Zoom in/out Functionality for adjusting the region of Interest.
